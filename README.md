# Blazor UI Libraries: A Comparative Analysis

Blazor is revolutionizing the way web applications are built. With a myriad of UI libraries available, developers often find themselves in a dilemma about which one to choose. One of the factors that play a crucial role in this decision is the file size of the libraries. A smaller file size ensures faster load times, offering a better user experience.

The table below provides an overview of the file sizes of various popular Blazor UI libraries:

| Library                                                         | File Size |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Blazor only**                                                 | 1.1 MB    |
| [**bit BlazorUI**](https://components.bitplatform.dev/)                                            | 1.3 MB    |
| [**MudBlazor**](https://mudblazor.com/)                         | 1.6 MB    |
| [**MatBlazor**](https://www.matblazor.com/)                     | 2.3 MB    |
| [**Radzen**](https://blazor.radzen.com/)                        | 2.7 MB    |
| [**Blazorise**](https://blazorise.com/)                         | 2.9 MB    |
| [**Ant Design**](https://antblazor.com/)                        | 3.2 MB    |
| [**Telerik**](https://www.telerik.com/blazor-ui/)               | 4.4 MB    |
| [**Syncfusion**](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/) | 4.8 MB    |
| [**DevExpress**](https://www.devexpress.com/blazor/)                                              | 12.8 MB   |

The comparison above is based on the DLL, JS, and CSS files required to utilize five components from each of the mentioned libraries. While file size is just one of the many criteria to consider when choosing a UI library, it's imperative to understand its impact on the application's performance and user experience.
